<template #about>

I'm a software engineer specializing in JavaScript & TypeScript. I'm interested in web development tooling and helping other engineers be more productive by improving their Developer Experience. I enjoy delving into low-level JavaScript concepts such as module resolution, static analysis, bundling, and AST transformations. I have expertise in a range of tools including Node.js, Rollup, Webpack, esbuild, Vite, and Vue.js.

As a Senior L6 Frontend SWE on the ECOM DX team, I develop tools to address common pain-points across Eng departments. I'm also the ECOM Open Source (OS) ambassador, and I encourage & drive OS contributions. Previously, on the ECOM Site Performance team, I helped optimize loading times & Lighthouse scores. On the ECOM Site Design team, I helped build a themeable Vue.js component library for our client websites.

On the Design Engineering team, I helped build a Vue.js component library with 50+ components. I collaborated extensively with Engineering & Design and developed a comprehensive tooling ecosystem (style guide, recipe-book, playground, auto-upgrade command, visual regression testing). I'm proud to be recognized as a top 10% performer in the Eng department.

<div class="print:hidden">

- As a student with a strong interest in web security, I identified and reported several critical vulnerabilities in their systems.

Here are some of the critical vulnerabilities I discovered:

<Heading
	size="5"
	annotation="January 26, 2013"
>Viewing another student's transcript</Heading>

Discovered a vulnerability on _BU Link_—a portal for students to manage their enrollment, view their own transcript, etc. Given a student ID (enumerable number), the vulnerability enabled unauthorized access to sensitive student information including grades, GPA, semester schedules, etc.

Reported to the  _Executive Director of Information Security_, Quinn Shamblin, and patched on January 29, 2013.

<Heading
	size="5"
	annotation="February 23, 2014"
>Downloading another student's homework</Heading>

Discovered a vulnerability on _BU Websubmit_—a portal for students to submit their Computer Science homework. Given a student's username, course ID, and project name (all public information), the vulnerability enabled unauthorized access to download their submitted homework files.

Reported to the _Manager of Systems Administration_, Paul Stauffer, and patched on February 24, 2014.

<Heading
	size="5"
	annotation="May 12, 2014"
>Intercepting BU Web Login authentication</Heading>

Discovered an XSS vulnerability on _BU Web Login_—BU's authentication system for student & faculty. Given a BU web server (provided to CS students), the XSS injection exploited the configuration file to enable intercepting an authentic login to steal credentials. Because the attack was server-side, a suspicious login URL didn't need to be constructed for the attack.

Reported to the _Executive Director of Information Security_, Quinn Shamblin.

I'm a highly enthusiastic Open Source developer who dedicates personal time to maintaining around 70 projects on GitHub. Several are popular and utilized by renowned developers, projects, and companies. Last month ({{ downloadMonthPretty }}), they were downloaded <span class="whitespace-nowrap">**{{ npmDownloads }} times**</span> ({{ downloadsPerSecond.toLocaleString() }}/sec). Here are some notable ones:

<ProjectCard name="tsx">

Enhanced Node.js to "just run" TypeScript & ESM code. It's zero-config so it's a beginner-friendly way to jump-start TypeScript development. Powered by esbuild.

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

I'm proud of this project because I managed to simplify a complex system behind a single command. The implementation required a deep understanding of Node.js internals and the intricacies between ESM and CommonJS (CJS). The development of this project also entailed the creation of independent loaders for [CJS](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/cjs-loader) & [ESM](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/esm-loader), [cleye](https://github.com/privatenumber/cleye)—a strongly typed CLI framework—, and [get-tsconfig](https://github.com/privatenumber/get-tsconfig)—a `tsconfig.json` resolver.

<ProjectCard name="esbuild-loader">

Webpack loader for transforming JS & CSS code using esbuild. It's a blazing fast alternative for popular loaders such as Babel, TypeScript, and Terser.

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

This project is my most popular project and what initially drew me to Open Source. I started as a contributor and eventually took over maintenance. The concept is straightforward, but required extensive work to execute correctly, especially when it came to handling two Webpack versions both at runtime & types, and testing them. To accomplish this, I developed tools such as [pkgroll](https://github.com/privatenumber/pkgroll), [webpack-test-utils](https://github.com/privatenumber/webpack-test-utils), [fs-fixture](https://github.com/privatenumber/fs-fixture), and [get-tsconfig](https://github.com/privatenumber/get-tsconfig). I'm also proud of my contributions to esbuild through [issue submissions and feature requests](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aprivatenumber).

<ProjectCard name="pkgroll">

Zero-config bundler for Node.js packages. It infers how to bundle the package by analyzing `package.json` entry-points and dependencies. Powered by Rollup & esbuild.

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

Pkgroll is my go-to bundler for my Node.js projects because it knows how to bundle them without any configuration. I created it to streamline my workflow, as I noticed I was repeatedly using the same Rollup configuration for most of my projects. It also reduces the effort required to manage entry-points in both `package.json` and build configuration, making it especially convenient for ESM and CJS distribution.

<ProjectCard
	name="minification-benchmarks"
	url="https://github.com/privatenumber/minification-benchmarks"
>

Comparison of JS minifiers based on minification, compression, & speed. Often referenced when picking a minifier. The project is automated and always up-to-date.

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

I created minification-benchmarks when esbuild first released JS minification, and I wanted to evaluate it against alternatives. I publicized the results to help developers select a minifier, and it was even linked by the esbuild website. The benchmark also functions as a test, aiding minifiers in identifying bugs and enhancing performance.

<ProjectCard name="tasuku">

A minimal Node.js library for elegantly displaying the progress of tasks in the terminal. It's unopionated and strongly typed, so it can easily enhance any CLI tool.

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

As a lazy engineer, I often write scripts to automate my workflow. I used to use [listr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/listr) to display the progress of my scripts, but I found it overly structured and limiting in terms of code organization. Seeking a simpler & unopinionated solution, I created tasuku, a lightweight alternative. Since adopting tasuku, I have been able to significantly improve the UX of my scripts with no additional effort.

<ProjectCard name="webpack-localize-assets-plugin">

Webpack plugin for multi-locale asset i18n. Very fast because it uses string manipulation, while predecessors used ASTs. [Used to localize StackOverflow.com](https://t.ly/B-Is).

<Collapsible class="print:hidden">

I made this plugin to improve the Webpack build time at work. Upon investigating bottlenecks, I found that our fork of the deprecated [i18n-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/i18n-webpack-plugin) was causing significant slow-downs. It localized at the [AST](https://jotadeveloper.medium.com/abstract-syntax-trees-on-javascript-534e33361fc7#:~:text=What%20is%20an%20Abstract%20syntax,result%20of%20a%20syntax%20analysis.) level, leading to asset generation & minification being multiplied for each locale. Inspired by how Rollup works, I used string-manipulation to localize minified assets. As there was no successor to i18n-webpack-plugin, I decided to open source my solution.
